Why does MyP2PWeb search for relays on some devices but on others it goes right to online?

For devices that are behind a firewall or inaccessible from the internet a relay must be used so other users can connect and pass data.
Relay searches can be slow and because all data must go to the relay to be passed to desired user instead of being send directly to the user and so the connection is slow.

Under Windows, MyP2PWeb will attempt to add itself as an exception however this may fail or the user has external firewall such as Mcafee or AVG ect or the user may change the port. 

If the port is not open for some reason, or if  MyP2PWeb is running a non-Windows operating system, then you will need to add an exception manually.
You can test if the port is open from MyP2PWeb by clicking the wrench button->Network Settings->Test Is Port Open

Configuring a firewall is fairly simple; you just need to open the TCP port in the firewalls 'exception' list.

First find your current port number by clicking the wrench button then Network Settings
The port number is the Listen Port

(1) Windows

Windows XP, Vista and 7 have a built-in firewall, which is on by default, and which you will need to configure.

(1a) Windows XP

Navigate through to Control Panel->Windows Firewall
Click on the 'Exceptions' tab, at the top of the window.
Click on the 'Add Port...' button
Name it "MyP2PWeb" and set the "Port Number" to Your Listen Port, select "TCP" then click OK.

(1b) Windows Vista

Navigate through to Control Panel > Windows Firewall
Click on "Allow a program through Windows Firewall", in the left-hand pane.
Click on the 'Add port...' button.
Name it "MyP2PWeb" and set the "Port Number" to Your Listen Port, select "TCP" then click OK.

(1c) Windows 7

Navigate through to Control Panel > Windows Firewall
Click on "Advanced Settings" in the left-hand pane.
Click on "Inbound Rules" and then "New rule".
Select "Port", click next then select "TCP" and enter "Your Listen Port as the local port.
Click next, and allow the connection.
Click next again, and ensure that "Domain", "Private" and "Public" are all ticked.
Name your firewall rule, then save it.

(2) Third-party firewalls

If you are using a 'third party' firewall (Symantec, Kaspersky, Mcafee, Avast, AVG) then you will need to refer to your particular firewall's documentation for how to do this. The easiest option is probably just to search (using a search engine, such as Google) for 'How do I open a port in X' with "X" being the name of your firewall software.

(3) UPNP Port Forward

If the firewall is not blocking the port it is possible your router has UPNP turned off.
MyP2PWeb uses UPNP to forward the internet TCP port to your device.
You may need to consult your router manual to turn on UPNP or manually forward the listen port to your device.
