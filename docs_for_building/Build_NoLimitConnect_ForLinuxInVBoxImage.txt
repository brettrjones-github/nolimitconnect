=== Build No Limit Connect For Linux in Virtual Box Image ===
1.) Follow the instructions in
        Create_Linux_Virtual_Image_With_Oracle_VirtualBoxMint19_2.txt
2.) Open GoTvOpenSslLib and build it
3.) Open GoTvPythonLib and build it
    if you get mv/copy errors the build the projects one by one ( may have to build twice )
4.) Open GoTvAll and build it
5.) after GoTvAll is built you can avoid extreme long rebuild times by buiding/debuging with
    GoTvPtoPAndCore  and libdepends.core and libpktlib and libnetlib as these are the most likely to be modified
