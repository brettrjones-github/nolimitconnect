=== Build No Limit Connect For Linux in Virtual Box Image ===
1.) Follow the instructions in
        Create_Linux_Virtual_Image_With_Oracle_VirtualBoxMint19_2.txt
2.) Open BuildX_XXX and build it in the order of the build number
3.) if you get mv/copy errors the build the projects one by one ( may have to build twice )  
5.) after all is built you can avoid extreme long rebuild times by buiding/debuging with
    Build6_AppAndCore_Optional as it contains the most likely to be modified
