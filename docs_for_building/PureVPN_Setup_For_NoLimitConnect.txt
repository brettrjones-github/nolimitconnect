//=== PureVPN Setup For NoLimitConnect ===//
Pure VPN is a commercial VPN available at
https://www.purevpn.com

//=== Port Forwarding ===//
For Chat Room and/or Group hosting a open port must be available
Also a open port speeds up communication for users by avoiding the
need of Chat Room or Group relay services. Relay services also
require a lot of bandwidth/CPU usage of the hosting group or chat room.

If you are familiar with routers you might be able to port forwarding
to your host without a VPN but how to do that differs from router to router.
Port Forwarding is not offered at all by phone data service.

A simple way to Port Forward is to use a VPN that offers port forwarding.
As of this writing most do not. This includes Nord VPN and Express VPN.

Pure VPN is a vpn service that offers port forwarding. 
Pure VPN also offers fixed IP addresses needed for NoLimitConnect network hosting.
This is not a advertisement for VPN but my experience with it was good
and it offers a simple setup for Android and Windows. Linux is more complicated
but can be done.

Pure VPN can be used on Phone Data service where port forwarding cannot be
done by your phone service provider.

//=== Fixed IP Address ===//
Fixed IP is only required if you want to create your own NoLimitConnect network.
Without a fixed ip then users would have to change there network host address to
match your ip address when your ISP provider changes it.
Pure VPN offers fixed ip at additional cost.
At the time of this writing 2020/12/20 Pure VPN Fixed IP is available on windows but not Android

//=== Pure VPN Port Forward Setup ===//

These instructions should work for all supported operating systems ( Android,Windows,Linux )

Please note: This is not and endorsement of any particular VPN but Pure VPN was the first VPN
I could get port forwarding to work on.
Other VPNs tried: 
	NordVPN - has no port forwarding
	ExpressVPN - has no port forwarding
	PrivateVPN - has a form of port forwarding but difficult to setup in linux

For this example the listen port in NoLimitConnect network settings was set to 45125
and will be referenced as [LISTEN PORT]
