2.) When Follow instructions for Change Allow app settings
	When selecting Public or Private check the box for both Public and Private

	
	

UPDATE: It seems that the above instructions did not work in all cases so here is a setup
that seems to always work (May have to restart computer after setup)
1.) follow steps 1 through 5 above to get to inbound rules
NOTE: for the following PATH_TO_APP means full path to application
	ie something like F:\nolimitconnect\bin-Windows\NoLimitConnect.exe
2.) Create the following Inbound rule

		Protocol Type: TCP
		Local port: All Ports
		Remote port: All Ports
	
	Advanced
		Domain: checked
		Private: checked
		Public: checked
		Edge transversal: Allow edge transversal
		
3.) Create another inbound rule same as above except
	General	
		Name: NoLimitConnect (TCP-In-Yes Edge)
		
	Advanced
		Edge transversal: Block edge transversal
		
4.) Create Outbound Rule
	General
