=== PureVPN Setup For NoLimitConnect ===

These instructions should work for all supported operating systems ( Android,Windows,Linux )

Please note: This is not and endorsement of any particular VPN but was the first VPN
I could get port forwarding to work on.
Other VPN's tried 
	NordVPN - has no port forwarding
	PrivateVPN - has a form of port forwarding but difficult to setup in linux

For this example the listen port in NoLimitConnect network settings was set to 45125
and will be referenced as [LISTEN PORT]

1.) Purchase a PureVPN subscription with the "Port Forward" addon package at https://www.purevpn.com
2.) Click the gear at top right of title bar to get to settings
3.) Click Select Mode
    Change PureVPN mode to File Sharing
4.) Click App Settings
    set Selected Protocol to SSTP
5.) Click Network Type
    set Network Type to Non-NAT Network
6.) Click Port Forwarding then Configure
    a.) Select Block all ports but enable the following
    b.) In Custom Ports enter [LISTEN PORT]
        NOTE: can add up to 15 ports if desired
    c.) Click Apply Settings and log out or close the web page
7.) Click Back to get back to home window of PureVPN
8.) Choose a country with less authoritarian network laws and connect.

9.) If you are running on windows then will need to open the firewall
	To open port on firewall read Open_Port_In_Firewall_Windows10.txt
