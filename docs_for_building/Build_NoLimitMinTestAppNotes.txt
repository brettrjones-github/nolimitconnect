A minimal application NoLimitMinTestApp is available to test your build/debug enviroment
It is from qt examples with some modifications

The enviroment can be done with default kits (As Of this writing Qt version 5.12.3)

//=== android specific notes ===//
For android there is currently special requirements

Android build SDK android-25
The Qt Creator version 4.10.0 does not seem to require QML debugging turned on

Qt gave errors about could not connect to QML debugger which I canceled out off
But the debugging worked anyway

# not needed for the minimal app but here for reference
# In your enviroment add ANDROID_NDK_PLATFORM android-21
# For windows build of android
# ANDROID_NDK_ROOT <ndk installed directory>\android-ndk-r18b

//=== build NoLimitMinApp ===//
under <checkout directory>/GoTvApps/NoLimitMinTestApp
open NoLimitMinTestApp.pro
Rebuild and run
