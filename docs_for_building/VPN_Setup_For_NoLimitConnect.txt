//=== VPN Setup For NoLimitConnect ===//
// If possible use a VPN that supports port forwarding through the VPN for faster and better connectivity and ability to enable hosting

IVPN is a commercial VPN with port forwading simple setup and no spam or twitsted promotions. Worked on all my devices.
https://www.ivpn.net
Pure VPN is a commercial VPN with port forwarding for additional cost. 
https://www.purevpn.com
PrivateVPN - Has a form of port forwarding but difficult to setup in linux
Proton VPN - Had port forwarding but seems to have been broken in their updates
NordVPN - Does NOT have port forwarding.
ExpressVPN - Does NOT have port forwarding except when run as firmware on a router. Not useable for cellular data networks.
SharkVPN - Does NOT have port forwarding.


//=== Port Forwarding ===//
For Chat Room and/or Group hosting and/or Random Connect hosting, an open port must be available.
Also a open port speeds up communication for users by avoiding the
need of Chat Room or Group or Random Connect relay services. Relay services also
require bandwidth/CPU usage of the host providing the relay service which may impact its speed and response time.

If you are familiar with routers you might be able to port forwarding
to your host without a VPN but how to do that differs from router to router.
Port Forwarding is not offered at all by phone data service.

A simple way to Port Forward is to use a VPN that offers port forwarding.
As of this writing most do not. This includes Nord VPN and Express VPN.

IVPN is a vpn service that offers port forwarding with one button click to turn it on and simple setup for all platforms.
Pure VPN is a vpn service that offers port forwarding. 
Pure VPN also offers fixed IP addresses needed for NoLimitConnect network hosting.
This is not a advertisement for Pure VPN but my experience with it was ok
and it offers a simple setup for Android and Windows. Linux is more complicated
but can be done.

A VPN with port forwarding can be used on Phone Cellular Data Service where port forwarding cannot be
done by your phone service provider.

//=== Fixed IP Address ===//
Fixed IP is only required if you want to create your own NoLimitConnect network.
Without a fixed ip then users would have to change there network host address to
match your ip address when your ISP provider changes it.
Pure VPN offers fixed ip at additional cost.
At the time of this writing 2020/12/20 Pure VPN Fixed IP is available on windows but not Android

//=== Pure VPN Port Forward Setup ===//

These instructions should work for all supported operating systems ( Android,Windows,Linux )

Please note: This is not and endorsement of any particular VPN but Pure VPN was the first VPN
I could get port forwarding to work on.
Other VPNs tried: 
	NordVPN - has no port forwarding
	ExpressVPN - has no vpn port forwarding for OS
	PrivateVPN - has a form of port forwarding but difficult to setup in linux

For this example purevpn was used and the listen port in NoLimitConnect network settings was set to 45125
and will be referenced as [LISTEN PORT]
