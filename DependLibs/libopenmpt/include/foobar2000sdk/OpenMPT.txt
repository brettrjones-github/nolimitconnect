This directory contains the contents of the foobar2000 SDK 1.3. (SDK-2015-08-03.zip).
- Compiler options "/wd4995 /wd4996" were added in foobar2000/SDK/foobar2000_SDK.vcxproj
  to make the SDK build free of warnings (which we do not care about for external source code).
- Various VS2017 warning have been disabled.
- Project files have been converted to VS2015 by opening and resaving them once
  in VS2015.
- Instruction set extensions have been disabled in all project files in order to
  support running foo_openmpt on systems without SSE2.
