In order to get android support v7 to work
=== setup files for VisualGDB ===
If building using VisualGDB then will need the build.xml and local.properties files from AndroidV7SupportFiles
and copy them to C:\android\android-sdk-20140702\sdk\extras\android\support\v7\appcompat
if they dont exist
also change the line target=android-17 in project.properties to your target api

==== enable save before build in eclipse ====
1.) Click Window > Preferences.
2.) Select General > Workspace from the list.
3.) check Save automatically before build

==== Setup apcompat v7 support ====
File->Import->Existing Android Code Into Workspace
Right click MyP2PWeb->Properties
under Android add reference link to android-support-v7-appcompat

All Manifests must have same min and target sdks. seems to be api 17 only or wont actually find class
This includes sdk\extras\android\support\v7\appcompat\project.properties

If you see error 
error android-support-v7-appcompat] Could not find android-support-v7-appcompat.apk!
Then you probably have the android-support-v7 as a project instead of library

1.) First Open SDK Manager and make sure that "Android Support Library" under "Extras" is installed there.
inside your work space remove "appcompat_v7" from eclipse and also its directory permanently

2.) File|Import|Android(Existing Android Code into Workspace) then Hit Next
Choose Root directory as "ADT_BUNDLE_INSTALLED_DIRECTORY\sdk\extras\android\support\v7" 
then under projects check "appcompat" then hit "Finish"

3.) Right Click on your project and hit "properties" and do the following:

from "Android" section, make sure target is selected there below there there is "library" 
section remove the old one and browse for the new one "appcompat_v7"
from "Java Build Path" section, go to "libraries" tab and remove any missing library if you found any.

from "Java Build Path" section, go to "Order and Export" tab and highlight only for the following and keep the same order:

projectName/src
projectName/gen
Android Private Libraries
Android Dependecies
from "Project References" section, check "appcompat_v7"

==== dont know if this works but here for reference ====
Android Support Library is obsolete.
To Install Open SDK Manager and check the box to show obsolete 
 Then check Android Support Library ( Obsolete)

In Eclipse right click MyP2PWeb->Android Tools->Add Support Library

Make sure you have downloaded the Android Support Library using the SDK Manager.
Create a library project and ensure the required JAR files are included in the project's build path:
Select File > Import.
Select Existing Android Code Into Workspace and click Next.
Browse to the SDK installation directory and then to the Support Library folder. For example, if you are adding the cardview project, 
browse to /extras/android/support/v7/cardview/.
Click Finish to import the project. For the v7 cardview project, you should now see a new project titled android-support-v7-cardview.
In the new library project, expand the libs/ folder, right-click each .jar file and select Build Path > Add to Build Path. 
For example, when creating the the v7 cardview project, add the android-support-v7-cardview.jar file to the build path.
Right-click the library project folder and select Build Path > Configure Build Path.
In the Order and Export tab, check the .jar files you just added to the build path, so they are available to projects that depend on this library project. 
For example, the cardview project requires you to export the android-support-v7-cardview.jar file.
Uncheck Android Dependencies.
Click OK to complete the changes.
You now have a library project for your selected Support Library that you can use with one or more application projects.
Add the library to your application project:
In the Project Explorer, right-click your project and select Properties.
In the category panel on the left side of the dialog, select Android.
In the Library pane, click the Add button.
Select the library project and click OK. For example, the appcompat project should be listed as android-support-v7-cardview.
In the properties window, click OK.
